    "### Evaluation of PDF Extraction Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "When extracting data from the *FY2024 Analysis of Revenue and Expenditure*, the main goal is accurate recovery of fiscal tables and numerical information, not visual fidelity. Below is a concise evaluation of three libraries—`pdfplumber`, `PyMuPDF`, and `Unstructured`—followed by justification for selecting `pdfplumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### pdfplumber\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**  \n",
    "- Exposes word-level and coordinate-level data, allowing controlled reconstruction of tables using positional logic.  \n",
    "- Reliable for structured text and numeric extraction; text is rarely dropped or merged.  \n",
    "- Fully deterministic and reproducible, ideal for analytical pipelines.  \n",
    "- Lightweight, dependency-free, and easy to integrate with pandas or JSON-based workflows.  \n",
    "- Offers visual debugging tools for verifying extraction boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**  \n",
    "- Cannot fully preserve original table layout.  \n",
    "- Slower on large PDFs and lacks built-in OCR support.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyMuPDF (fitz)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**  \n",
    "- Very fast and memory efficient.  \n",
    "- Good for mixed content and extracting images or metadata.  \n",
    "- Maintains reading order in simple, single-column layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**  \n",
    "- Treats text as large blocks, often merging table columns and misaligning data.  \n",
    "- Requires manual heuristics to rebuild tables.  \n",
    "- Less transparent control for structured data recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unstructured\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**  \n",
    "- Uses heuristic and ML-based segmentation to divide documents into logical elements like titles, paragraphs, and tables.  \n",
    "- Supports multiple file formats and integrates well with document-to-LLM pipelines.  \n",
    "- Can include OCR and layout models for scanned documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**  \n",
    "- Converts tables into plain text, losing numeric alignment.  \n",
    "- High dependency overhead and slower performance.  \n",
    "- Geared toward semantic understanding, not numerical precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for Choosing pdfplumber\n",
    "\n",
    "`pdfplumber` is chosen not because it preserves layout perfectly, but because it offers consistent, coordinate-based extraction that can be empirically validated and programmatically controlled. In testing with the FY2024 budget PDF, it reliably captured all key fiscal values—operating revenue, tax categories, fund top-ups—without omission or distortion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, its output required less postprocessing to align figures with labels than PyMuPDF or Unstructured. Beyond empirical accuracy, it provides transparency, reproducibility, and fine-grained positional access, all critical for a data-centric workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, even though it lacks native table layout reconstruction, `pdfplumber` remains the most practical and reliable tool for structured financial document analysis, balancing interpretability, precision, and minimal setup.\n"

After factoring in Top-\\nups to Endowment and Trust Funds of $24.3 billion, Net Investment Returns\\nContribution (NIRC) of $22.9 billion, Capitalisation of Nationally Significant\\nInfrastructure of $3.5 billion, and Significant Infrastructure Government Loan\\nAct (SINGA) Interest Costs and Loan Expenses of $0.2 billion, the Overall Fiscal\\nPosition for Revised FY2023 is a deficit of $3.6 billion (0.5% of GDP). This is larger\\nthan the $0.4 billion deficit estimated at Budget 2023. This is due to higher Total\\nExpenditure to meet priority areas such as catching up of projects deferred due\\nto COVID-19; funding for public healthcare institutions; and a top-up to the\\nMajulah Package Fund to boost the retirement and healthcare adequacy of\\nSingaporeans, as announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National\\nDay Rally 2023; partially offset by higher-than-expected Operating Revenue,\\nmainly due to stronger-than-expected economic growth.\\nThe Revised FY2023 fiscal position is shown in Table 1.1.\\n1.2 Operating Revenue\\nRevised FY2023 Operating Revenue is $104.3 billion, which is $7.6 billion (7.9%)\\nhigher than the Estimated FY2023 figure.

This is mainly due to higher\\nLand Betterment Charge collections from unforeseen redevelopment projects.\\nVehicle Quota Premiums collections are revised to $4.7 billion, which is\\n$0.8 billion (20.1%) higher than the Estimated FY2023 figure due to the\\nGovernment bringing forward COE quota from future years.

In China, growth is\\nexpected to moderate following its post-COVID reopening, but is expected to\\nbe cushioned by anticipated fiscal support.\\nNonetheless, downside risks to the global economy remain. Escalation of\\ngeopolitical tensions, notably the Israel-Hamas conflict and war in Ukraine,\\ncould lead to renewed supply disruptions and further commodity price shocks.\\nLatent vulnerabilities in banking and financial systems could become exposed\\nas monetary tightening continues to work its way through the global economy.\\nNotwithstanding these risks, the Singapore economy is projected to grow by\\n1.0% - 3.0%, and to perform at around its potential in 2024. The fiscal impulse\\nis expected to be 0.1% of GDP in FY2024, indicating little change to the fiscal\\nstance relative to FY2023.

    "\n",
    "The system employs a supervisor pattern implemented in LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revenue Agent: Extracts and analyzes all government income sources (Corporate Tax, GST, Excise, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expenditure Agent: Interprets expenditure allocations and identifies funding mechanisms (e.g., Future Energy Fund, Infrastructure Support).\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervisor Responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Route sub-queries to agents based on domain relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregate responses into a cohesive answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison: Fan-in/Fan-out vs Supervisor Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, two multi-agent orchestration strategies were considered: **Fan-in/Fan-out** and the **Supervisor Pattern**. Both have distinct strengths and trade-offs that influence scalability, accuracy, and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fan-in/Fan-out Pattern with Router as the Supervisor\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fan-in/Fan-out Pattern](images/fan-in-out.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach decomposes a complex query into smaller sub-tasks through a router or decomposer. Each sub-task is dispatched to specialized agents that run in parallel. The results are then aggregated by an aggregator model to form the final answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly structured and deterministic, allowing parallel execution and efficient handling of well-defined problems. However, its rigidity can lead to missed context if the router fails to allocate subtasks correctly. The absence of a review loop also means that partial or incomplete results might go unnoticed. Fan-in/fan-out patterns are best suited for pipelines where sub-tasks are independent, and the decomposition logic is fixed (for example, extraction of multiple unrelated entities).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervisor Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "![Supervisor Pattern](images/supervisor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor pattern introduces a central coordinating agent that maintains reasoning control throughout the workflow. The supervisor dynamically decides which specialized agent to call, interprets intermediate responses, and iteratively refines the conversation until a complete answer is formed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers interpretability and flexibility, allowing dynamic re-prompting and oversight of agent performance. However, it can be less parallel and may risk missing simultaneous sub-tasks if not explicitly designed for concurrency. It is ideal for open-ended reasoning tasks where interpretive understanding and contextual synthesis are more important than raw throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is however more challenging to implement with Langgraph because of out the box, langgraph implemetnation of agent is simplistic and even with detailed context engineering, it is difficult to instruct the agent to address multiple parts of the question. There could be other design options, such as attaching a decompostion tool to the agent, but this proves unable to achieve good results either. It might be easier to implement with crewai, but langgraph is utilized (with customization) for ease of telementry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This project adopts the **Supervisor Pattern**. The reasoning tasks—identifying revenue streams and explaining how the Future Energy Fund will be supported—require interpretive synthesis across multiple fiscal dimensions. The supervisor model provides traceable, iterative reasoning, ensuring that both revenue and expenditure perspectives are considered before producing the final comprehensive answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor is a custom-made agent with the following logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It takes in all the previous messages and states, determining the next step, including which agent to call.\n",
    "- The next step is “finish” if the terminal condition is met. The terminal condition is determined by the LLM — either by fully answering the question and calling all tools, or by reaching `max_loop`.\n",
    "- Its main job is routing, and at no point in time is it allowed to answer the question directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is max_loop chosen?\n",

However, there are many challenges, since this task is not a ranking task but an extractive summmarization, that means that you have to go through all the parts of the documents to extract all relevant parts.
